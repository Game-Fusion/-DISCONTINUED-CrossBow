<p>The next generation of consoles is upon us, and with that Game Fusion and Nova have decided to usher in the new generation in style. Featuring a high-end, powerful file browser, designed with CrossBow in mind, you'll be able to work in style. Speaking of style, CrossBow is a true next-gen experience, with crisp visuals coating the system in graphical brilliance. CrossBow also makes games extremely easy for developers to port, meaning you'll get the latest releases as they come.</p>

<a id="the-first-of-its-kind" class="anchor" href="#the-first-of-its-kind" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The first of its kind</h2>

<p>CrossBow is going to be one of if not the first next-gen console to release. This means hype levels are going to be high. Because of all of this potential hype, we've ensured the system will undergo an entire stage of polishing everything up and smoothing out rough edges, including but not limited to performance improvements, graphical enhancements and feature improvements.</p>

<p>CrossBow's visual splendour is second to none; it has slick animations executed in real time. All it takes is 1 line, and a coloured wave will glide across the screen. So how do they do this? It's simple; the Subsistence API. Subsistence can perform real-time graphical brilliance swiftly and easily. Any developers using Subsistence for graphics will find their games looking superb, and evidence of Subsistence making things look great is in the CrossBow menus. Everything is polished, there's animations in real-time with incredible visual elegance in a sophisticated style. And all of this is only in CrossBow, powered by Subsistence.</p>
